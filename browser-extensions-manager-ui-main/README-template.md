## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries
- DOM Manipulation

### What I learned

Apprently some legacy DOMs on certain browsers had a function called "all()" and i found that out because i tried to call my custom "all()" function onclick and it didn't do anything.

Since there were no errors nor were my console.logs working, debugging it was "fun" üòê.

### Continued development

I could not figure out how to edit the color of the header SVG for the dark theme
